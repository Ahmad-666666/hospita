		<p><strong> 1. Traditional Food Systems of Indigenous Peoples Barbara Burlingame, PhD FAO
<br><br>2. Definitions Indigenous peoples (PFII, 2007) • Self- identification • Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies • Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources • Distinct language, culture and beliefs • Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities Traditional food systems • Local access • Ecosystem service • Product of traditional knowledge and the natural environment • Naturally resilient, adapted food plants and animals
<br><br>3. Issues • Diets are not sustainable – 870 million hungry people – 2 billion people with micronutrient malnutrition – 2 billion people overweight and obese • Environments are not sustainable – ecosystems degraded – biodiversity forever lost • Food systems are not sustainable – Deforestation, intensive livestock industries, imports of “popularly positioned products”, agricultural and industrial chemical contaminations

<br><br>7. Definition of Sustainable Diets Sustainable Diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources.

We need our plants and our jungle in order to have strength and to live better.” Eva Yela, Ingano community member
